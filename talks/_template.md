# CFP Outline/ Guide
 
**Talk title:** varies on conference, some are ‘fun’ some are ‘serious’. This can always change. I recommend having 2 or 3 options here to choose from. 

Short description (~65 characters): 1 sentence on what you’ll go over. Give a few options here as well. 

**Abstract**: 300 word elevator pitch. This should make someone want to sit down and listen to you talk. You can start by answering the questions in “Long Description” in one sentence each for this abstract and then expand on them for more detail.

**Long Description**:
(First, no you don’t have to answer every single one of these - this is to help you brainstorm 🤔. And… you’re not writing an essay. This is your opportunity to explain why this is a compelling idea for a talk. Don’t make it too long, an expansion for 2–3 paragraphs from your Abstract about should suffice.)

- What will you go over? Detail the procession of what this talk would look like. 
- Where did you get this idea?/ What’s the history behind this talk/ technology?
- Why is this of interest? 
- Why are you proposing this solution?
-  What problem are you fixing?
- What will the audience learn/ takeaway?
    - If you’re writing for a specific conference mention it here.
- …take a step back. Think about what questions an audience may ask you. How can you incorporate those answers here? (this applies to when you’re building your presentation 😃 )
