title: Finding Future Maintainers
abstract:
AI has made writing code trivial, but it has also created an open-source crisis: maintainer burnout is at an all-time high, while trust and ownership have hit rock bottom. We’re drowning in AI-generated pull requests from unknown contributors, and the experience of maintainers is leaving faster than we can say LGTM. Tribal knowledge dies with each departure.

This talk reveals how to break the cycle using data to identify high-potential contributors early, create documentation cultures that capture implicit knowledge before it walks out the door.

We’ve optimized for code velocity and we should now be optimizing for knowledge transfer.
